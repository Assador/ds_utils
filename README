ds-utils is a pack of CLI/GTK+ Perl and Bash scripts, useful in web development
and just in work in different desktop environments. Scripts were written to run
under GNU/Linux, but most of them also might work in another operating systems,
if all of the dependencies were satisfied, of course. However, it has not been
tested enough. As itâ€™s scripts with plain text inside, all brief descriptions
are placed right to the start of each script file as comments.
